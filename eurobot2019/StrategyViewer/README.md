# Strategy viewer

A GTK-based viewer for playing a trajectory on a PC, to get a fell of what the robot will do.
This is not a simulator, only a viewer.

The code is somewhat experimental and may be a bit unstable...

Images: for diplay, images stored in the config folder are used. The following is the expected format.
 - Robot image: image should form a square of 500x500mm (image is then scaled for display). The center point of the
 robot should be at the center of the image.
 - Table image: the table should be centered in a 4000x3000mm square.
